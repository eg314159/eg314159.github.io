<p>Hi! I'm a recent graduate of Columbia University, where I double-majored in mathematics and computer science. I'm broadly interested applications of algebra and probability theory to Theoretical Computer Science, particularly to sublinear algorithms, high-dimensional computational geometry, and modern algebraic methods for algorithm design. I am currently working on a research project with Professor Mikhail Khovanov about the probability distribution of elements generated under multiplication in the Temperley-Lieb Algebra. I am also working on developing a more efficient graph streaming algorithm for the high-dimensional minimum spanning tree problem with Professor Alexandr Andoni. In Fall 2022, I will an incoming theoretical CS Ph.D. student at Princeton University.</p>
