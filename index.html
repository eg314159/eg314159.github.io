  <h1>Elena Gribelyuk</h1>
<p> 

Hi! I'm a PhD student in theoretical computer science at Princeton University. In 2022, I graduated from Columbia University, where I double-majored in mathematics and computer science. </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
 I'm primarily interested in randomized algorithms, particularly streaming/sketching algorithms, graph algorithms, communication complexity. Most recently, I've been thinking about adversarial robustness in the streaming model.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
During the summers of 2020-2022, I was a mathematics instructor at the King Summer Institute, where I taught the six-week accelerated Pre-Calculus course to 10-15 students. My responsibilities included teaching for 3 hours/weekday, writing all course materials, holding instructor office hours, and meeting with students individually to check in and offer additional help when needed. 

Also, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses at Columbia University. My responsibilities included grading homework and exams, holding office hours and recitations, writing practice problems, and editing lecture notes.

<ul>
  <li>COMS 4995 Advanced Algorithms, taught by Professor Alexandr Andoni in Spring 2022</li>
  <li>CSOR W4231 Analysis of Algorithms, taught by Professor Alexandr Andoni in Fall 2021</li>
  <li>MATH UN2030 Ordinary Differential Equations, taught by Professor Evgeni Dimitrov in Fall 2021</li>
  <li>CSOR W4231 Analysis of Algorithms, taught by Professor Xi Chen in Summer 2021</li>
  <li>COMS W3261 Computer Science Theory, taught by Timothy Randolph in Summer 2021</li>
  <li>MATH GU4042 Modern Algebra II, taught by Professor Inbar Klang in Spring 2021</li>
  <li>COMS W3203 Discrete Math: Combinatorics and Graph Theory, taught by Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021</li>
</ul>
I also lectured and served as a TA for the Columbia Undergraduate Math Society's Introduction to Proofs workshop in 
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~ums/introproofs2020.html">Fall 2020</a> and <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~ums/IntroToProofsFall2021.html">Fall 2021</a>.
This is a 4-week workshop for undergraduate students that teaches how to
write and construct proofs.

<h2>Other</h2>
Outside of TCS/math, I love classical music and playing the piano (my favorite composer is Rachmaninoff :)). I'm also passionate about math education, and I am a part-time mathematics instructor at <a href ="https://princeton.aopsacademy.org/?_gl=1*1cmmme3*_ga*MzYwODQzMTQwLjE2ODg2OTA3OTE.*_ga_NVWC1BELMR*MTY4ODY5MDc5MS4xLjAuMTY4ODY5MDc5My41OC4wLjA."> Art of Problem Solving</a> (Princeton location) in my free time.
